# Park & Sons Co. Essential Tremometer: Parkinson's and Essential Tremor Diagnostic and Quantification System

This is a standalone accelerometer based tremor quantification system. Using an array of signal processing techniques, the diagnostic system provides insight into the characteristics of hand/arm tremors. Along with a number of other metrics, analysis includes tremor detection, amplitude quantification, and frequency analysis in the Fourier domain. Using these calculated metrics, a score indicative of the severity of tremor is devised. Additionally, the MDS Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UDPRS) has been fully integrated for physican input. Duke BME 464 senior capstone design project.
